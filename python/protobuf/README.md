These protocol buffer class files are generated by the betterproto python protobuf compiler from proto definition files in the other git repos, and coppied here.

# [rov_action_api](rov_action_api/__init__.py)
Generated from [rov_actions.proto](https://github.com/KW-M/rov-web/blob/main/src/lib/proto/rov_actions.proto)
in the [rov-web](https://github.com/KW-M/rov-web) repo. This is a purely protobuf definition file, and is only used by the python code and website (no grpc involved).

# [webrtcrelay](webrtcrelay/__init__.py)
Generated from [webrtc-relay.proto](https://github.com/KW-M/webrtc-relay/blob/main/webrtc-relay.proto) in the [webrtc-relay](https://github.com/KW-M/webrtc-relay) repo.
This is a grpc protobuf definition file, and is used by the python code to interface with and control the webrtc-relay locally. None of these messages reach the web browser, however some messages tell the webrtc-relay program to send bytes to or from the web browser.
(Those bytes will be the encoded bytes of the rov_action_api proto messages).
